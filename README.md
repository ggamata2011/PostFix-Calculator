# PostFix-Calculator
A Simple PostFix Calculator Written in C++

This is a PostFix Calculator I have written for a class project which demonstrates the use of a stack to evaluate postfix expressions. Besides support for common operators such as + - * /, I have also included support for exponents, calculating averages, negation, factorial and the sum of all operands to the left of the operator "S".

Note: Expressions are written as such with spaces "4 5 7 2 + - *" not "4572+-*"
